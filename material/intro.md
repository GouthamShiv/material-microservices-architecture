# Introduction

> ## Why Microservices?

-   It is the most popular architecture paradigm
-   Microservice is not tied to specific technology
-   Solves real problems
-   A thought for consideration:
    ```text
    "If microservice are implemented incorrectly or used as a
    band-aid without addressing some of the root flaws in your system,
    you'll be unable to do new product development because you're drowning in the complexity."
      - Alexandra Noonan, Engineer, Segment
    ```

> ## Things covered

-   What microservices architecture is
-   What problems does it solve
-   How to design a robust, scalable, easy to maintain microservices architecture
