# Microservices Architecture

> 9.  ### Evolutionary Design

`When moving from monolith to Microservices, the move must be gradual.`

-   It might be tempting to break everything apart and start from scratch. But this is really the right path.
-   The best approach is to start small and upgrade each part separately.
    -   This way, we change the system gradually creating a modular system.
    -   And we will have a lot of opportunities to find out if we have broken something.
