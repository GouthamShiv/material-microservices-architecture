# Microservices Architecture

> 3.  ### Products not Projects

`With traditional projects, the goal is to deliver a working code. This is what the team is working on and it the end goal of the project.`

-   The team is focused on the project and the project plan usually ends when the code is delivered.

-   Working like this, the team developes no lasting relationship with the customer.

-   Many times, the team has no acquaintance with the customer at all. Only the project manager and system analyst will meet the customer and the developers have no idea who is the customer, how do they look like and what do they need, they probably never even talk to him.

-   In addition, after the code is delivered, the team often moves on to the next project and the developers get assigned to other projects.

-   **This is a problem,** when the team focuses on delivering the code they don't really see the customer and don't think like a customer. And so, we see many times software projects that have great code, that utilizes great algorithms and is very effective and clear, but does not deliver the product the customer actually wanted.

**`With microservices`**, the goal is to deliver a working product and not a working code.

-   The product is the most important thing to deliver and the code is just a means to an end. And if the code should be less elegant in favor of a better product, then so be it.

-   A product needs ongoing support and requires close relationship with the customer. No successful product can be designed without knowing what the customer actually wants.

-   And when the team understands that, it develops this relationship with the customer. And what's more is that the team is responsible for the microservice even after the delivery.

-   It is true that they might be developing other microservices, but they still own the service and still feel responsible for its success.

-   And even if the service should be handled to other team, it's done with a lot of thought and the original team makes sure that the new team knows everything there is to know about the service, the code and of course the customer.

-   There is a famous quote by AWS CTO Werner Vogels, that goes like this

-   `You build it, you run it`<br>
    by, Werner Vogels, AWS CTO

-   Meaning, your job is not done by building the service, you are responsible for successfully running it too.
    This mindset can change the way the team thinks about the service and make them be more invested in it, which will definitely contribute to its success.

-   Now, this attribute of thinking like the customer and involve him in the process might remind you of the `agile manifesto`.

-   This manifesto, published in 2001, defined some principles of `agile development` and is considered the foundation of the agile development movement.

    -   One of the main goals of this manifesto was to involve the customer's involvement in the development process.
    -   It is not a co-incidence that customer's involvement is mentioned in the agile manifesto and in the microservices attribute.
    -   Over the past few years, it was recognized that such an involvement is actually a win-win situation.
    -   The customer gets a better product and the developes produce better software.
    -   Because of which, we will often see microservices based systems implemented using agile methodology.

> **Motivation:**

-   `Increase customer's satisfaction:`
    -   When the team thinks like the customer, the end result will be more like the customer's needs and will fit its needs.
        This will definitely make the customer more satisfied with the product.
-   `Change developers' mindset:`
    -   Another effect is changing the developer's mindset by adopting the product, not the project attribute.
        The developers change their mindset and become even better developers.
    -   This will greatly help the team, not only the current service but with future ones as well.
