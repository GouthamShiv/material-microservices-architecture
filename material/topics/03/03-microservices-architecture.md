# Microservices Architecture

-   Problems with monolith and SOA led to a new paradigm.
-   It had to be modular, with simple API.
-   The term `microservices` first appeared in 2011.
-   In 2014 Martin Fowler and James Lewis published their "Microservices" [article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).
    -   This became the de-facto standard for Microservices definition.
